This folder contains the code for two models:
1) A basic Neural Network implementation (Basic_NN.ipynb)
2) A Convolution Neural Network (Conv_NN.ipynb)

Additionally, the training and testing data has been split out and placed in the "test_data" and "train_data" respectively. Further comments may be found in the respective NN/CNN Jupyter Notebooks.
